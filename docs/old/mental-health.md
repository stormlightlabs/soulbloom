# Mental Health Card Game Design

## Core Game Components

### Card Types

1. **Emotion Cards** (30 cards)
   - Represent different emotional states (joy, anxiety, sadness, etc.)
   - Each card has an intensity level (1-3)
   - Include both challenging and positive emotions

2. **Coping Strategy Cards** (40 cards)
   - Tools and techniques for managing emotions
   - Categories: Physical, Social, Mental, Creative
   - Each card has effectiveness ratings for different emotions

3. **Support Cards** (20 cards)
   - Represent external resources and assistance
   - Include professional help, friends, family, and community resources

## Game Mechanics

### Setup

- Players start with 5 cards each
- Draw pile contains mixed cards
- Players begin with a "Baseline Wellness" score of 10

### Turn Structure

1. **Check-In Phase**
   - Draw one card
   - Play or discard one Emotion card face-up
   - Emotion cards affect Wellness score based on intensity

2. **Response Phase**
   - Play Coping Strategy or Support cards to address active emotions
   - Cards must match or exceed the emotion's intensity
   - Multiple players can contribute support cards

3. **Recovery Phase**
   - Successful coping increases Wellness score
   - Draw back up to 5 cards

### Special Rules

- **Chain Reactions**: Similar emotions can stack, requiring stronger responses
- **Support Bonus**: Playing matching support cards together provides additional benefits
- **Wellness Threshold**: If a player's Wellness drops below 3, others can use Support cards to help

## Victory Conditions
